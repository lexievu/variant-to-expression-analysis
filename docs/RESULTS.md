# Results: AlphaGenome Expression Predictions for TCGA LUAD Somatic Variants

> **⚠️ Important disclaimer:** The results below are **model predictions only**, generated by Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome DNA foundation model. They have **not** been validated against real-world experimental data. Phase 4 of this project (correlation with patient RNA-seq, GTEx baselines, and independent expression measurements) has not yet been performed. These predictions should be treated as computational hypotheses, not biological conclusions.

## Overview

**Patient:** TCGA-05-4384 (lung adenocarcinoma, LUAD)
**Variant caller:** GATK MuTect2 (paired tumor/normal WGS)
**Model:** AlphaGenome (DNA → RNA-seq prediction)
**Tissue:** Lung (`UBERON:0002048`)
**Prediction window:** 1,048,576 bp (1 MB) centered on each variant
**Date run:** 14 February 2026

Starting from 3,970 somatic variants in the VCF, the pipeline filtered to **8 HIGH-impact variants** (PASS filter, VEP HIGH impact, gene expressed in patient RNA-seq). Each was submitted to AlphaGenome, which predicted RNA-seq expression tracks for both the reference and alternate alleles.

## Key Findings (Model Predictions Only)

### 1. AlphaGenome predicts no significant expression changes

All 8 variants received a **Neutral** classification. The largest absolute log₂ fold-change was 0.0044 (LAMC3), far below the ±1.0 threshold for gain or loss of expression. This means AlphaGenome predicts that none of these HIGH-impact somatic variants — including frameshifts and stop-gained mutations — meaningfully alter overall gene expression at the DNA-sequence level.

**Possible interpretations (unvalidated):**
- The model may be correct: many somatic variants in coding regions alter protein function without changing transcription levels. A stop-gained mutation produces a truncated protein, but the gene may still be transcribed at normal levels (unless NMD degrades the transcript).
- The model may lack sensitivity to certain variant types (e.g., indels, splice-region effects) or may not capture cis-regulatory disruptions at this resolution.
- The 1 MB prediction window sums expression across the entire interval, which may dilute local effects near the variant.

### 2. Scoring layer differentiates vaccine suitability

While AlphaGenome alone classifies all variants identically (Neutral), the biological scoring layer separates them into actionable tiers:

- **3 HIGH-priority** (FAM107A, LAMC3, DOT1L): clonal variants (VAF ≥ 0.2) in expressed genes (TPM ≥ 1.0), no NMD, no predicted expression loss. These are the best candidates for further vaccine target investigation.
- **3 MEDIUM** (TMTC1, MMP25, ELFN1-AS1): partial evidence — either subclonal (VAF < 0.2) or the gene is lowly expressed (ELFN1-AS1 at 0.44 TPM).
- **2 LOW** (TTC7A, ERBB2): flagged by NMD despite strong expression and clonal presence. Notably, ERBB2 has the highest TPM (222.22) and a clonal VAF (0.36), but NMD annotation suggests the mutant transcript would be degraded before translation.

### 3. ERBB2 — a notable case

The ERBB2 (HER2) variant is particularly interesting. It has the highest expression (222 TPM), a clonal VAF (0.36), and only a tiny predicted expression change (log₂ FC = −0.0023). However, VEP flags it with NMD, which would prevent the mutant protein from being produced. This illustrates why the scoring layer is essential: AlphaGenome does not model post-transcriptional mRNA surveillance.

## What These Results Do NOT Tell Us

1. **Whether the predictions are accurate.** We have not compared AlphaGenome's predicted expression to the patient's actual RNA-seq data. The patient's `Example_RNA.csv` contains observed TPM values, but a formal correlation analysis (Phase 4) has not been performed.

2. **Whether the variants alter protein function.** AlphaGenome predicts transcription-level effects from DNA sequence. It does not predict protein folding, stability, or immune visibility. A Neutral expression prediction says nothing about whether the mutant protein is functional or immunogenic.

3. **Whether these are good vaccine targets in practice.** Vaccine target selection requires MHC binding prediction (e.g., NetMHCpan), immunogenicity assessment, and population-level recurrence analysis — none of which are part of this pipeline.

4. **Whether the NMD annotations are correct in this tumor context.** NMD efficiency varies between tissues and can be impaired in cancer. The NMD flag is based on VEP's transcript-level annotation and may not reflect the actual NMD status in this patient's tumor.

## Next Steps (Phase 4 — Not Yet Started)

- [ ] Correlate AlphaGenome predictions with patient RNA-seq TPM (Pearson/Spearman)
- [ ] Stratify by expression bins (TPM > 1 vs. < 1) to assess model sensitivity
- [ ] Compare against GTEx lung expression baselines to distinguish tumor-specific vs. tissue-normal silencing
- [ ] Generate summary visualisations (scatter, volcano plots)
- [ ] Consider expanding to HIGH+MODERATE impact variants (46 total) for broader coverage

## Reproducibility

```bash
conda activate biotech_challenge

# Step 1: Filter (already done — output exists)
python src/2_vcf_filter.py                          # → output/high_impact_variants.vcf

# Step 2: Predict (requires ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY in .env)
python src/3_gene_expression_prediction.py          # → output/raw_predictions.tsv

# Step 3: Score (no API needed)
python src/4_score_variants.py                      # → output/scored_variants.tsv
